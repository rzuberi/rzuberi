# Rehan Zuberi

PhD researcher in Medical Sciences (AI in Oncology) at the University of Cambridge, working at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute.

I design multimodal machine learning systems that integrate histopathology, genomics, and clinical data for early cancer progression prediction, with emphasis on reproducibility, safety, and deployment in research infrastructure.

## Current Projects

### [Multimodal progression prediction in Barrett’s oesophagus](https://github.com/rzuberi/barretts_progressor)  
Developing and benchmarking multimodal models combining histopathology and copy number variation data to predict progression risk in Barrett’s oesophagus.

### [llm-contrib-game](https://github.com/rzuberi/llm-contrib-game)
Designing and running repeated public-goods games where agents are LLMs executed as SLURM jobs via Ollama on HPC infrastructure.  
The framework enables controlled experiments on multi-agent coordination, contribution dynamics, communication effects, and model-level behavioural differences, with full job-level logging and experiment aggregation.

### [hpc-llm](https://github.com/rzuberi/hpc-llm)
Building a SLURM-backed local LLM inference tool for CRUK CI that enables reproducible, logged, GPU-based model execution on institutional HPC infrastructure.

### [uk-citizenship-practice](https://github.com/rzuberi/uk-citizenship-practice) [Live](https://rzuberi.github.io/uk-citizenship-practice/)
Static GitHub Pages site for Life in the UK practice questions wiht a fast topic-first workflow and pre-computed LLM context generation for each question.
