# Rehan Zuberi

PhD researcher in Medical Sciences (AI in Oncology) at the University of Cambridge, working at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute.

I design multimodal machine learning systems that integrate histopathology, genomics, and clinical data for early cancer progression prediction, with emphasis on reproducibility, safety, and deployment in research infrastructure.
